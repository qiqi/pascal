# What's it for                                                                 

Pascal is a tool for generating stencil computation code in C.
It decomposes a stencil update formula into atomic stages, and translates
each stage into C code, to be plugged in into a stencil-based computational
framework.

# Download and use
The best way to download pascal is using pip. Pip is likely included in
your Python installation. If not, see [instruction
here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). To install pascal
using pip, simply type

```
sudo pip install pascal
```
